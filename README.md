<h1>GRIM REPOS GRIM MANOR PROJECT</h1>

## Intro

<p>You are presented with the image of a dark mansion on a rain-soaked night. Text invites you to seek refuge and enter. </p>
<p>Once indoors, a gloomy corridor with multiple doors greets you and a young, pale man appears. Your challenge is to complete a series of minigames to find clues as to what happened to the young man.</p>
<p>When you have completed the minigames, the clues you have gathered will tell the story of what happened to the young man, you can complete the exit quiz and you will have completed the game!</p>


## Goal

- ➡️ Problem Statement

Create a website which fits the theme of Halloween; is responsive and accessible for different screen sizes and has a positive user-experience. 

- ➡️ Objective(s)

<p><i>-Creative design</i></p>
<p>We based our colour scheme on an AI generated image of an Old Woman with Ouija board which is contained within the game…</p>
<img src="assets/readme-images/old-woman-ouija-board.png" center>
<img src="assets/readme-images/colour-scheme.png" center>

<p>The image is a representation of the feeling we want the game to inspire. The mist and soft-lighting from the candles have a slightly creepy and spooky undertone whilst not being too overtly frightening. The colour palette containing the soft hues of the blues and greens therefore reflect the eerie tones we are aiming whilst still creating enough of a contrast to be seen clearly by the user. </p>
<p>We chose the font Risque as our base font:</p>
<img src="assets/readme-images/risque font.png">
<p>This was because we felt that it was in-keeping with the style of an old-time mansion whilst also being easily legible and interesting to look at.</p>  
<p><i>Moving around</i></p>
<p>On laptop/desktop, users will be able to click on the doors/stairs and access the mini-games. </p>
<p>On tablet/mobile screens, simply shrinking the image would make it too small and give a poor user experience so users will be able to pan left and right within the mansion to be able to see the doors and then access the mini-games in the same way. </p>  

<p><i>Responsiveness</i></p>
<p> In this project, we made the decision to display the full-sized image on both mobile and desktop for the main game. On mobile, it means that the user needs to pan the screen, which creates the feeling that they are looking around the house.
For the minigames, we made sure that these work on both mobile and desktop, so they are resized appropriately.</p>


<p><i>Future improvements</i></p>
If we were to take this website further, we would add more mini-games to upstairs doors and windows. The paintings and skylights, when clicked, would produce jumpscares where ghosts popped out. Apparitions of the pale young man would appear at random to give more of an eerie feel. Local storage would be utilised more so that, instead of an exit quiz which you had to click on, when you completed all of the mini-games the game would automatically generate the exit questions allowing you to be freed from the house. The games would then be replayable but with more general answers rather than story specific answers.  

- ➡️ Target Audience

<p>We decided that our project would be spooky but not ‘scary’. This means that the website has a distinct Halloween feel but is accessible across a wider range of ages and temperaments. </p>
<p>Although younger children might find the overall design of the website to be frightening, the mini-games themselves are accessible to children of approximately 8 years and up. </p>
<p>The games have the ability to be replayed as, once the clues have been solved, the local memory will recognise this and allow the games to become standalone. </p>

- ➡️ Benefits

<p>The user experiences enjoyment of the spooky story through interactive mini-games. When they have collected all the clues, they can solve the mystery and have a sense of completion to the game. 


## Tech

<p> We used:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Bootstrap 4</li>
